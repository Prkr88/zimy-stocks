## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for a significant UI/UX enhancement for the Zimy Stocks application. While the current application provides powerful features for stock market analysis, this revamp aims to elevate the user experience by making it more intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient for all users, from novice investors to experienced traders.
